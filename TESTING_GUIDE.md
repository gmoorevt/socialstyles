# Social Styles Assessment - Testing & Verification Guide

## Assessment Math Validation ✅

The scoring logic has been verified with comprehensive unit tests covering:
- All 4 social style quadrants
- Boundary conditions (2.5 cutoff)
- Edge cases and mixed responses

### Scoring Formula (VERIFIED CORRECT ✓)

```python
# Questions 1-15: Assertiveness (scale 1-4)
assertiveness_score = sum(responses[1:16]) / 15

# Questions 16-30: Responsiveness (scale 1-4)
responsiveness_score = sum(responses[16:31]) / 15

# Social Style Determination (cutoff: 2.5)
if assertiveness >= 2.5 and responsiveness >= 2.5:
    style = "EXPRESSIVE"
elif assertiveness >= 2.5 and responsiveness < 2.5:
    style = "DRIVER"
elif assertiveness < 2.5 and responsiveness >= 2.5:
    style = "AMIABLE"
else:  # assertiveness < 2.5 and responsiveness < 2.5
    style = "ANALYTICAL"
```

- [x] Responsiveness calculated from Q16-30 (average of 15 responses)
- [x] Scores range from 1.0 to 4.0
- [x] Cutoff point is 2.5 (midpoint of 1-4 scale)
- [x] ANALYTICAL: Assert <2.5, Resp <2.5
- [x] DRIVER: Assert ≥2.5, Resp <2.5
- [x] AMIABLE: Assert <2.5, Resp ≥2.5
- [x] EXPRESSIVE: Assert ≥2.5, Resp ≥2.5

### ✅ Display & UI
- [x] Questions display in Likert scale format
- [x] 30 total questions (15 assertiveness + 15 responsiveness)
- [x] Scale options: 1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Somewhat Disagree, 3=Somewhat Agree, 4=Strongly Agree
- [x] Dashboard shows scores as x/4.0 (not x/5.0)
- [x] PDF report uses 1-4 scale with 2.5 cutoff lines

### ✅ PDF Report
- [x] Chart displays correct 1-4 scale (not 1-5)
- [x] Quadrant divider lines at 2.5 (not 3.0)
- [x] User position plotted correctly
- [x] Quadrant labels positioned correctly

## Known Issues & Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: PDF Chart Scale Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** PDF chart showed 1-5 scale with 3.0 cutoff, but scores are 1-4 with 2.5 cutoff
**Fix:** Updated `app/assessment/utils.py`:
- Changed axis limits from (1,5) to (1,4)
- Moved cutoff lines from 3.0 to 2.5
- Repositioned quadrant labels

### Issue 2: Dashboard Display Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Dashboard showed scores as "x/5.0" instead of "x/4.0"
**Fix:** Updated `app/templates/assessment/dashboard.html` line 71-72

### Issue 3: Question Format ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem:** "Paired opposites" format was confusing
**Fix:** Updated to clear Likert scale statements:
- "I typically take charge in group situations"
- "I am direct in my communication style"
- Clearer, more direct questions
